## Overview
The challenge is to build a web tool that take in an IP and get it Location, ISP, Region, Country, timezone and it latitude and longitude to display it address on map. By default it gets the device's IP address. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
